# Overview

The FortiManager ZTP Flow (ZTPF) Framework is a NOSOAR (Not Only SOAR) solution for streamlining provisioning and operational objectives on multiple FortiManagers. The power of FortiSOAR workflow and automation provides flexible solutions for onboarding, lifecycle, and offboarding objectives. FortiSOAR integrates with one or more FortiManagers via API and consumes asset details to be used for provisioning objectives. 

Playbook automation focused on FortiManager functions can streamline common tasks, such as but not limited to, metadata management, provisioning templates, custom device scripts, policy object templates, and device configuration installations. Workflows can be customized to integrate external systems, engage operational teams, or simply respond to conditions of network elements to achieve network operational tasks. Using an industry-standard template language, [Jinja]( https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/), provisioners can easily pick up customized templates. Use FortiSOAR as a portal to multiple FortiManagers or run in the background as an automated solution to ensure your [Fortinet Security Fabric](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/security-fabric) is managed to your exact specifications.
